4. returns array discounted with the new set of 3 discounted prices (for loop adds discounted prices of the prices array to discounted)
5. error as i undeclared (declared inside for loop)
6. error as discountedPrice unclared (declared inside for loop)
7. will print to console 150 because it would be the last value of finalPrice after the last iteration of for loop
